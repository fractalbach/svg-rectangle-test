# svg rectangle test

An experiment with a full-page sized SVG element in a web page.  Uses
the dimensions of the
[Golden rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle)
and maintains that aspect ratio regardless of screen size.  A
potential Secondary goal would be for the rectangle to rotate itself
when in portrait mode.
